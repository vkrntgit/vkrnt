Everyone in tech start at almost the same line. Some race ahead. Yet some turn into SMEs. We all have the same 24 hours in the day. Some make more out of it than others. I think the differentiator is how we exploit each hour. Learning new tech - fast - gives you a huge advantage. May prefer the approach of courses and certification.

Learning this way takes longer though. Learning a completely new platform/tool/tech can be daunting. Coffee can only carry you for a couple of hours. An easy way to learn consistently and grow in a new area is to break down the subject matter into bite size lessons. There is a significant qualititative difference in understanding and ability to apply knowledge when you focus all your attention on a ten minute information nugget - as against racing through a hundred pages or watching a web course at 2x speed.

The jump from learning to applying knowledge is tougher when you absorb a ten hour course or complete a three hundred page book over a weekend.
