Everyone in tech starts at almost the same line. Yet some race ahead and turn into SMEs. We all have the same 24 hours in the day. Some make more out of it than others. I think the differentiator is how we exploit each hour. Learning new tech - fast - gives you a huge advantage. Many prefer the approach of courses and certification.

Learning this way takes longer though. Learning a completely new platform/tool/tech can be daunting. Coffee can only carry you for a couple of hours. An easy way to learn consistently and grow in a new area is to break down the subject matter into bite size lessons.

The jump from learning to applying knowledge is tougher when you absorb a ten hour course or complete a three hundred page book over a weekend.
