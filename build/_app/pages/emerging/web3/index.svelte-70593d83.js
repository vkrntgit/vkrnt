This guide walks through using and putting together the tools, technologies, and protocols needed for real-world dapp development, including:

The Graph
Polygon Technology
IPFS
Next.js
Hardhat
Ethers.js

At around 7,000 words, this is the most in depth tutorial I've written in my career and is, again, writing for myself had I entered the industry today.

This is the fourth post in my web3 series that's now been read over 500,000 times, here are the other three posts in that series:
