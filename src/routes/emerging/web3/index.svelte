<h2> Web3 </h2>
What is Web3?<br>
Web3 is a web app architecture that runs apps on blockchains or decentralized networks (cryptoeconomic protocol).
This is a whole new way of deploying and accessing apps - very different from the server-to-browser protocol of serving apps (web2).
If there is no server, where is the app hosted? Many 'network participants' host the service. What was done by Cloud providers in web2 is done at a microscopic level by network participants.

Why is Web3 important?<br>
Web3 attemps to overcome three main challenges with Web2 apps
Monetization Challenges Web2 apps rely on user volume growth, selling user data as a primary means of making money.
Privacy Users have little control on their data or awareness of how it is stored or distributed.
Security Financial transactions through Web2 apps are under strict government control. Bank accounts or access to finances can be shut down by the ruling authorities at will. This gives the authorities a lever on how technology companies shape their apps and manage user data.

Will Web3 ever make it big?
There is a rising tide of Web3 developers, investors and users
Performance and rate of adoption of dapps (decentralized apps) is still a major concern
If Web3 development and investments race ahead of regulations and we get serious value out of future dapps, web3 will be bigger than web2 [opinion]
It is still highly unlikely that the YouTubes of the world are going away for a couple of decades. Web3 might become an extension of the Internet we know today, not a replacement.[opinion]
