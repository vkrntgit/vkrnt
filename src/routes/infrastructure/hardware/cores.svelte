  <h2>Cores</h2>
  Deep dive into hardware.. Notes on Cores.
  <br /><br />
  CPUs are the processing units in a computer. In the last century, a motherboard
  used to have one processing unit (one CPU). With the dawn of the twenty first century,
  most computers are at least dual core. Now (2022) we have personal use computers
  with eight or sixteen core CPUs. High-end commercial use computers can have upwards
  of 64 cores.
