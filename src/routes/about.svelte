  This website is a small side project to research and share the latest in technology,
  leadership in IT and the application of technology to real world business problems.<br
  />
  <br />
  I share my thoughts in the Blog section. The Slipbox is a collection of notes on
  technologies that I have worked on and the ones I am exploring. <br /><br />

  This site was developed with sveltekit and is hosted on a GCP VM. <br /><br />
