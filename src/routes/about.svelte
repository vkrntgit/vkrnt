I â™¥ tech.<br> 
<br>
This website is a small side project to research and share the latest in technology, leadership in IT and the application of technology to real world business problems.<br>
<br>
I share my thoughts in the Blog section. The Slipbox is a collection of notes on technologies that I have worked on or am exploring. <br><br>

This site was developed with sveltekit and is hosted on a GCP VM. <br><br>
