<div class="meat">
Did you notice how often the word 'unprecedented' was thrown around in 2020? <br><br>
The year started with WhatsApp forwards of people fainting on streets in China and in three short months reached a near global lockdown. 
Nobody knew what would happen next. 
Everyone had an opinion though. 
V and K curves of recovery were discussed just weeks into the lockdown - laughably early in hindsight. 
The fear of an unknown disease was mixed with cheery new routines at home and in video calls. 
But things turned serious in the business world. 
Businesses thrive on stability and disintegrated with uncertainty. 
2020 was anything but stable.<br><br>

There were so many contradictory forces at play. 
Revenues could take a hit, but businesses had to be ready for sudden spikes in sales. 
Staff became critical for business continuity, yet many lost their jobs to cost reduction exercises.
And while cost reduction became a huge priority, all businesses incurred new costs - most of them mandatory. 
Inside organisations, the uncertainty was amplified - especially deeper into 2020. 
Demand for some skills shot up beyond available supply and yet more techies than ever were out of job (we all remember the #OpenForWork flood on LinkedIn). 
Employees expected steady pay, continued growth but also demanded stronger insurance coverage, more flexibility and 'permanent' remote work. <br><br>

If we step back a few years and stand in the shoes of a C-suite executive, life was already full of challenges. 
More work than a human can handle, insane expectations from investors, subordinates and employees in general, 
need to stay ahead of the evolving technology landscape, process tons of data and take the right decisions 
all while coming off as charming and likeable. 
These are tough challenges. But these challenges evolved over half a century of growth in the IT sector. 
And let's be honest, the technology sector has borrowed heavily from manufacturing and other industries 
(Six Sigma, Waterfall development, organization structures).
Each new challenge also created trainings and a pool of knowledge on how to handle them. 
Time management is the staple of many a leadership books. Handling stress, managing expectations, 
conflicts, organisation strategy, personality development, human psychology, organisation behaviour, 
communication skills - these are the bread and butter of management schools and leadership coaches. <br><br>

How many pre-2020 books and courses have you seen dedicated to the subject of handling a global technology company in the midst of a pandemic? <br><br>

Answer: Zero. <br>This is the technology sector's very first global calamity.<br><br>

The rapid growth of technology in the last two decades has brought an avalanche of leadership opportunities in tech. 
Many a technology veterans rose into management and leadership roles.  
Granted these leaders typically have the qualifications and skills to rise above the rest, 
but the rough seas of 2020 brought out the real Captains from the crowd. 
Businesses steered by leaders with courage to make tough decisions took off. 
Leaders who brought out the best in their people and business in this storm are leaders worth following.<br><br>
